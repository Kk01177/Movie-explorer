## Description

Movie Explorer is a user-friendly web application built to allow movie lovers to discover and track their favorite movies. The app utilizes the OMDb (Open Movie Database) API to provide detailed information about movies, including the title, plot summary, release year, and poster image. Users can search for movies by title and add their favorites to a personal list for easy access later. This app is perfect for anyone looking to organize their movie-watching experience or explore new films based on detailed information.

In a world where there is a seemingly endless number of movies to watch, Movie Explorer simplifies the process by giving users all the information they need at their fingertips. Whether you want to remember movies you've seen or discover new ones to watch, this tool helps you build a personal movie collection quickly and easily.

## Features

- **Search for Movies**: The app allows users to search for movies by title using the OMDb API. It then displays essential details like the movie's title, plot summary, release year, and poster.
- **Favorites List**: Users can add movies to their favorites list, making it easy to track the films they want to watch again or keep for future reference.
- **View Movie Information**: Once a movie is found, detailed information, including the title, plot summary, release year, and poster image, is displayed on the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The website automatically adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring that it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Remove Movies from Favorites**: Users can remove movies from their favorites list if they no longer wish to keep them saved.

## How to Use

1. **Search for a Movie**: Type the title of the movie into the search box and click "Search & Add."
2. **View Movie Details**: After searching, the movie's details, such as its title, plot, release year, and poster, will be displayed.
3. **Add to Favorites**: Click the "Add to Favorites" button to save the movie to your personalized list.
4. **Remove from Favorites**: If you wish to remove a movie from your favorites list, simply click "Remove" next to the movie in your favorites list.

## Technologies Used

The Movie Explorer app was built using a variety of modern web technologies to ensure both functionality and a smooth user experience. Here's a breakdown of the technologies used:

- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**: HTML forms the structure of the website, including the movie search bar, buttons, and sections where movie details are displayed.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: CSS was used to style the website and make it visually appealing. It ensures the layout is clean, and the design is mobile-friendly. CSS media queries ensure the app looks great across devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is responsible for the dynamic elements of the app, such as interacting with the OMDb API, managing the favorites list, and updating the page without needing to reload. The app fetches data from the API and displays it dynamically.
- **OMDb API (Open Movie Database API)**: The OMDb API is an essential part of this project, providing movie data such as title, plot, release year, and posters when a user searches for a movie.
- **localStorage**: The browser's `localStorage` feature is used to store the user's favorite movies, ensuring that the list is maintained even if the page is refreshed or the user returns later. This gives the user a persistent experience across sessions.
- **GitHub Pages**: The app is hosted using GitHub Pages, which is a free and easy way to deploy static websites. This makes it easy to share the app with others and access it online from anywhere.

## How It Works

When a user enters a movie title and clicks "Search & Add," the app sends a request to the OMDb API to fetch relevant information about the movie. The OMDb API returns the movie's title, plot, release year, and poster image, which is then displayed on the screen.

The favorites list is stored in the browser's `localStorage` to make sure that the list persists even after a page refresh. When a user adds a movie to their favorites, it gets saved to `localStorage` and will appear in the favorites section. Similarly, when the user removes a movie from their list, it is deleted from `localStorage`, ensuring the list stays updated.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was ensuring that the favorites list would persist even after the user refreshed the page. To solve this, I utilized the `localStorage` API, which allows the storage of data locally in the user's browser. This ensures that the favorites list remains intact during a session or across multiple visits.

Another challenge was creating a responsive design that would work well on both desktop and mobile devices. By using CSS media queries, I was able to ensure that the layout adjusts depending on the screen size, making the app accessible on all devices.

## Next Steps

- **User Authentication**: In the future, I plan to integrate user authentication, allowing users to sign in and save their favorites list on the server rather than relying on `localStorage`. This will enable users to access their list from any device.
- **Movie Reviews and Ratings**: Adding the ability for users to leave reviews and rate movies they add to their favorites list could enhance the app's functionality.
- **Enhanced Movie Data**: The app could be expanded to display additional data about movies, such as cast information, trailers, and user ratings, potentially by integrating other APIs or expanding the OMDb API’s usage.

## Conclusion

Movie Explorer is a simple, yet powerful app that helps movie lovers discover films, track their favorites, and easily access movie information. With a clean and responsive design, it’s perfect for movie enthusiasts who want a quick way to search for and organize movies. The app is lightweight and performs well across different devices, making it accessible anywhere.

As the project grows, I plan to introduce more features such as user accounts, reviews, and additional movie information to make it even more useful for users who want to keep track of their movie collections.
